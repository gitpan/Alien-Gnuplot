=head1 NAME

Alien::Gnuplot - Find and verify functionality of the gnuplot executable.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package MyGnuplotter;

 use strict;

 use Alien::Gnuplot;

 $gnuplot = $Alien::Gnuplot::executable;

 `$gnuplot < /tmp/plotfile`;

 1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

NOTE: Alien::Gnuplot is currently experimental, with a 1.0 release
planned for Spring 2013.  Please report your experience to
craig@deforest.org.  Patches that work for your system are welcome and
appreciated!

As an Alien module, Alien::Gnuplot just verifies existence and sanity
of the gnuplot executable.  It doesn't have any methods.  Using
Alien::Gnuplot checks for existence of the executable, and also 
sets several global variables:

=over 3

=item * C<$Alien::Gnuplot::executable> gets the path to the executable that was found.

=item * C<$Alien::Gnuplot::version> gets the self-reported version number of the executable.

=item * C<$Alien::Gnuplot::pl> gets the self-reported patch level.

=item * C<@Alien::Gnuplot::terms> gets a list of the names of all supported terminal devices

=item * C<%Alien::Gnuplot::terms> gets a key for each supported terminal device; values are the 1-line description from gnuplot.

=back

You can point Alien::Gnuplot to a particular path for gnuplot, by
setting the environment variable GNUPLOT_BINARY to the path.

If there is no executable application in your path or in the location
pointed to by GNUPLOT_BINARY, then the module throws an exception.
You can also verify that it has not completed successfully, by
examining $Alien::Gnuplot::version, which is undefined in case of
failure and contains the gnuplot version string on success.

=head1 INSTALLATION STRATEGY

Installation initial work is done by the Makefile.PL, which attempts
to install gnuplot via common package managers on particular
platforms.  If package management fails, Makefile.PL creates a script
to generate a default install of the included gnuplot source code.
(Downloading from the official Sourceforge repository would reduce
load on CPAN, but it is impractical -- Sourceforge obfuscates download
links in a way that confuses LWP and HTTP::Tiny).

=head1 REPOSITORIES

Alien::Gnuplot development is at "http://github.com/drzowie/Alien-Gnuplot".

Gnuplot's main home page is at "http://www.gnuplot.info", and the source code
tarball in src is downloaded from there.
